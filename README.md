To construct an effective sales prediction model using the XGBoost algorithm, begin by clearly defining the problem at hand, which involves forecasting future sales based on historical data.Opt for XGBoost due to its proficiency in handling intricate relationships and nonlinear patterns, and fine-tune its hyperparameters for optimal performance. Train the model, utilizing cross-validation to assess generalization capabilities. Evaluate the model's performance on the testing dataset, employing metrics such as Mean Squared Error or Root Mean Squared Error. Conduct feature importance analysis to gain insights into the driving factors behind sales predictions.

How to launch(MOTE THAT THIS IS ONLY APPLICABLE IF THE INTERPRTER IS COLAB)


Step 1:Run the "Sales_predict.ipynb" file in this given repo


Step 2:Install the gradio in the console by "pip install gradio" command


Step 3:Once installed run the code "gradio" given in this repo


Finally you can see the predicted accuracy and the front end for predicting the sales accurately which we launch in the "gradio" platform



WARNING:This is worked in the Kaggle interpreter but there are some upgrades and installation command which can be available according to system compatible in the browers....
